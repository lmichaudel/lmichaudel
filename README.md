# ðŸ‘‹ Hi there

Iâ€™m Lucas Michaudel â€” a computer science & mathematics enthusiast from France.

I love writing efficient solutions with limited resources, using low-level langages. I build graphics engines using technologies like Vulkan and OpenGL. I can also work with C# and Lua in game and tool pipelines. I take a lot of fun building complex projects like physics engine or state-of-the-art networking solutions. 

Iâ€™m always eager to explore new graphics techniques, engine architecture, and efficient systems coding.
